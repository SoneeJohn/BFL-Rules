# BFL-Rules Keeper Rules

**Note: It should be noted that even with a keeper league you do not need to partipate in keeping players. Thefore, if these rules seem too complex having these rules enacted would not affect your experience playing fantasy.**

In an effort to make the league a more **enjoyable** and **fair** experience for everyone involved I am proposing we start a keeper league. I know some of you might be hesitant to start such a thing and there are legitimate concerns of how fair this might be (i.e., people keeping players forever) but because how customized we can make our rules this proposal will address those concerns. I also understand some people think keeper leagues are complex but it really doesnâ€™t have to beâ€”again itâ€™s very customizable. Give this document a read and let me know what you think.

### Basics 
A keeper league simply means that you are allowed to keep `x` amount of players on your roster for the next draft, all the other players that a manager does not keep gets released into the pool for the next auction draft. Of course there are rules to how many players you can keep as well as how long you can keep them.

### The Pros & Cons of a Keeper League
Keeper leagues are more fun because they allow for long and short-term benefits. Here are some of the pros and cons:
 Pros:
- Allows you to show off your skills as a GM
- You'll feel more like a real general manager
- Those who didnâ€™t draft well actually have hopes for rebuilding their team next season (more on that in the article)
 Cons:
- Slightly more planning involved when drafting (if thatâ€™s con for you then you shouldnâ€™t be playing fantasy ðŸ˜‰)
### Proposal
Here is a high level overview of the rules we can implement for our league (remember these can be adjusted so if you donâ€™t like a rule please voice your concerns in the chat).
Rules:
- 3 keepers: A team can only keep a maximum of 3 players on their roster from the previous season to remain on their roster for the upcoming season. Of course this is not mandatory, and you can elect not to keep any players.
- 2 season limit: Keepers can only be kept for one additional season from the season they were drafted. After the additional season the player returns to the pool and the GM cannot redraft that player during the draft of the upcoming season. A GM must wait for one season to past before redrafting that player. For example, if during the 2019-2020 season a `GM A` decides to keep a player for an additional season (2020-2021) during the next draft season (2021-2022) `GM A` cannot redraft that player. However, during the (2021-2022) season `GM B` drafts said player and elects not to keep that player for the (2022-2023) season then `GM A` can redraft that player.
-  Keeper base value: The keeper base value is based on the amount the player was originally drafted at.
	- A special case will be made ONLY for the 2020-2021 season. The top 30 players cannot have a base value that is lower than the values on hashtagbasketball.com, however, their base value can be higher but never lower. For example, Luka Doncic has a value of $34 because he is in the top 30 his base value can be higher but not lower than $34. This allows fairness but also rewards those GMs that got certain players at a seal in the 2019-2020 season. In the 2019-2020 season Luka was drafted at $18 it would be unfair to have this as his base value going into the next season. For a list of the top 30 players an their values view the table [here](https://github.com/SoneeJohn/BFL-Rules/blob/master/AUCTION%20VALUES%20(2019-2020).md)
- Keeper fee: The keeper fee is 20% of the keeper base value. Also, the keeper fee cannot be less than $1 so in the case of players drafted at $1 instead of their fee being 20% of $1 being .2 their fee would be $1. All fees are round to the nearest ones place. For example, when calulating the keeper fee for Kawhi Leonard (drafted at $76 * 0.20) = 15.2 his keeper fee would be $15.
### Example
During the next season draft say SpaceShuttlers decides they want to keep James Harden this is what will happen:
- Because James was drafted at $81 if they decide to keep him then they will pay $81 + (20% of 81 being $16) = $97 in order for him to keep James for the 2020-2021 season. So that means going into the auction draft he will efficiently have $200-97 = $103 to draft other players
- The league commissioner can set the value of any player.

### Consolation Bracket 
For those who werenâ€™t lucky enough to make the playoffs the winner of the consolation bracket will be award $20 extra for the next auction. This allows teams that didnâ€™t draft well to have hopes of rebuilding their team next season, and gives them an incentive to not drop all their players in the pool. So say for example, Team Harris, wins in the consolation bracket, next season he will have a $220 auction budget.

### Conclusion
As you can see a keeper league can make things slightly more challenging but also more rewarding, and with the current rules I believe they allow for 1) not having people easily dominate the league for years to come and 2) allow for easy rebuilding if you didnâ€™t do so well in the last draft. I would love to hear your thoughts and I am happy to adjust the rules if need be.
